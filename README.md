# Color-Changer
This is a simple and interactive Color Generator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On each click of the button, it generates a random RGB color, changes the background accordingly, and displays the selected color. It also uses localStorage to preserve the selected color across browser reloads.
